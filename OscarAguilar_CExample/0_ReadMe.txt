In these files one will be able to find my work for the Masters Course 
"System Driven Hardware Design, in which C and Matlab were used to develop 
a band pass amplifier was designed, in order to amplify the signal of a IPM 165 24GHz radar
and then feed it to a FreeSoc2’s ADC module, in order to subsequently pass that signal’s 
data through a UART port to Matlab, and to be visualized and analyze through a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). 
Hardware, 
Software, 
and Filter Design can be seen in the PDFs listed as 1st Part, 2nd Part and 3rd Part.
The developed C code can be found in "..\OscarAguilar_CExample\SoftwareSDHD.cywrk.Archive01\SoftwareSDHD\OAguilar_766468_SoftwareDevelopmentAssignment.cydsn\source"
Whereas the Matlab code can be found in "..\OscarAguilar_CExample\MatlabCodeAndFigures"
